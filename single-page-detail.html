        <p class="detail-heading">Lauterbrunnen Valley, Switzerland</p>
        <p class="detail-discription">Like something straight out of The Sound of Music, the Lauterbrunnen Valley is endlessly picturesque, thanks to its
        green valleys, snowy peaks
        and charming alpine villages.
        Lauterbrunnen is first mentioned in 1240 as in claro fonte. In 1304 it was mentioned as Luterbrunnen.
        
        The oldest trace of a settlement in the area is a single Roman coin which was discovered in the Blumental.
        
        When the Lauterbrunnen Valley first appears in the historic record, during the 13th century, it was owned by the
        Freiherr of Wädenswil. In 1240
        the Freiherr of Wädenswil sold the Sefinen Valley to Interlaken Monastery. Over the following century, the Monastery and
        other local lords began
        to expand their power in the Lauterbrunnen and neighboring valleys. However, around 1300, the Lord of Turn began to
        settle his Walser speaking
        people in the nearby Lötschen Valley and into the highlands of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. By 1346, the Walser villages of
        Lauterbrunnen,
        
        Gimmelwald, Mürren, Sichellauenen and Trachsellauenen all had village governments and a certain amount of independence
        from the Monastery.
        Three years later, much of the Bernese Oberland unsuccessfully rose up against Monastery. When the Monastery suppressed
        the rebellion,
        the Walser villages bore the brunt of the Monastery’s wrath.
        
        By the 15th century, the villages of the valley were part of the large parish of Gsteig bei Interlaken (now part of
        Gsteigwiler). Between 1487 and 1488,
        the villagers in Lauterbrunnen built a filial church of the parish. In 1506, the parish appointed a full-time priest for
        Lauterbrunnen. In 1528, the city of
        Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and began imposing it on the Bernese Oberland. Lauterbrunnen
        joined many other village
        and the Monastery in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they
        secularized the Monastery
        and annexed all the Monastery lands. Lauterbrunnen became the center of a new Reformed parish.
        
        Mines were built in the Trachsellauenen area in the upper valley beginning in the late 16th century. An iron smelter was
        built in Zweilütschinen
        (now part of Gündlischwand) in 1715 to process the iron ore from Trachsellauenen. However most of the money from the
        mines went to the noble
        landowners. The villagers remained very poor. In the 17th and 18th centuries the poverty was so widespread that many of
        the villagers joined
        mercenary regiments or emigrated. A majority of the emigrants moved to the Carolinas in the United States. Beginning in
        the late 18th century,
        foreign mountain climbers began to use Lauterbrunnen as a starting point for their expeditions into the nearby Alps.
        Initially the climbers stayed
        in the village rectory. However, as Lauterbrunnen’s fame grew and with the completion of a road from Interlaken in 1834
        and the 1890 Bernese
        Oberland Railway, more hotels were needed for tourists. As new hotels were built, other tourist infrastructure was also
        built in the village.
        
        They built cable cars to Mürren in 1891 and to Wengen in 1893. But the most significant piece of infrastructure was the
        Jungfrau railway which was
        built in 1912.
        
        The Jungfrau rack railway runs 9 km (5.6 mi) from Kleine Scheidegg to the highest railway station in Europe at
        Jungfraujoch. The railway runs almost
        entirely within a tunnel built into the Eiger and Mönch mountains and contains two stations in the middle of the tunnel,
        where passengers can
        disembark to observe the neighboring mountains through windows built into the mountainside. In 1909 the English brothers
        Walter and Arnold
        Lunn popularized skiing, curling and bobsledding at Lauterbrunnen. These winter sports provided a whole new group of
        winter tourists and converted
        the summer tourist industry into a year-round business. The tourist economy of Lauterbrunnen was devastated due to World
        War I and II and the
        Great Depression. However, following the end of World War II, tourism rebounded. Many new vacation homes and chalets
        were built along with
        ski lifts, chair lifts and a heliport..
